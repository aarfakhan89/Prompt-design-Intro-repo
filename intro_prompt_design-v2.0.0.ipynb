       "Okay, here's a list of ways Earth is unique compared to other planets we currently know of:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Fundamental Requirements for Life as We Know It:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Liquid Water on the Surface:**  This is a big one.  Earth's temperature and atmospheric pressure allow water to exist in all three phases (solid, liquid, gas) on its surface. Liquid water is considered essential for life as we know it, acting as a solvent and facilitating biochemical reactions.\n",
       "*   **Atmosphere with Oxygen:** Earth's atmosphere is rich in oxygen (around 21%).  This is primarily due to photosynthesis by plants and algae. Oxygen is crucial for respiration, the process by which complex life forms obtain energy.  Most other planetary atmospheres are dominated by carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or hydrogen/helium.\n",
       "*   **Habitable Temperature Range:**  Earth's distance from the Sun and its atmosphere create a temperature range that is conducive to liquid water and complex biochemistry. It's neither too hot (like Venus) nor too cold (like Mars, for the most part).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Geological Activity & Composition:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Plate Tectonics:**  Earth has a dynamic surface driven by plate tectonics.  This process recycles the crust, regulates temperature, and creates diverse landscapes.  We don't see this active plate tectonics on any other planet in our solar system (though some evidence suggests it might have existed on Mars in the past).\n",
       "*   **Active Volcanoes:** Volcanoes on Earth release gases from the interior, contributing to the atmosphere and playing a role in the carbon cycle. While other planets have volcanoes (e.g., Mars' Olympus Mons), Earth's are still actively shaping the planet.\n",
       "*   **Strong Magnetic Field:**  Earth's magnetic field, generated by the movement of molten iron in its core, deflects harmful solar wind and cosmic radiation, protecting the atmosphere and surface life.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Life and Biology:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Abundance of Life:**  This is the most obvious one. Earth is the only planet we know of that harbors life, and life in incredible abundance and diversity.\n",
       "*   **Complex Ecosystems:** Earth has intricate ecosystems with interconnected food webs and complex interactions between species.\n",
       "*   **Photosynthesis:** The prevalence of photosynthesis (using sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into energy and oxygen) has fundamentally shaped Earth's atmosphere and life forms.\n",
       "*   **Intelligent Life:** Earth is currently the only known planet with intelligent, technological life capable of self-reflection and exploration.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Other Factors:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Size and Mass:** Earth's size and mass are \"just right\" for retaining a substantial atmosphere without being a gas giant.\n",
       "*   **Distance from the Sun:** Earth resides in the \"Goldilocks zone\" of our solar system, where temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n",
       "*   **Presence of a Large Moon:**  The Moon stabilizes Earth's axial tilt, which helps to moderate the seasons and creates tidal cycles that may have been important for the origin of life.\n",
       "*   **Axial Tilt and Seasons:** Earth's axial tilt (approximately 23.5 degrees) causes the seasons, creating variations in temperature and daylight hours that influence life cycles.\n",
       "*   **Ozone Layer:** The ozone layer in Earth's stratosphere absorbs most of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, protecting life on the surface.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Important Considerations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Limited Sample Size:** Our understanding of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) is still evolving. We are constantly discovering new planets with potentially unique characteristics, and our definition of \"unique\" may change as we learn more.\n",
       "*   **Life as We Know It:** The list above focuses on conditions that support life as we currently understand it.  It's possible that life could exist in forms that are fundamentally different and require very different conditions.\n",
       "*   **Dynamic Planet:** Earth is constantly changing. Its uniqueness is not a static condition but rather a result of ongoing processes and interactions.\n",
       "\n",
       "This list gives a comprehensive overview of the factors that make Earth stand out among the planets we know. Remember that as our exploration of the universe continues, our understanding of planetary diversity will undoubtedly expand.\n"

       "    *   **Cons:** Requires electricity, can be expensive.\n",
       "    *   **Best For:** Everyday use, quick cups of tea/coffee, precise temperature requirements.\n",
       "*   **Stovetop Kettle:**\n",
       "    *   **Pros:** Relatively fast, uses a heat source you likely already have, whistling kettles provide an audible alert.\n",
       "    *   **Cons:** Requires supervision (to prevent boiling dry), can be less energy-efficient than electric kettles.\n",
       "    *   **Best For:** When electricity is limited or unavailable, traditional kettle preference.\n",
       "*   **Microwave:**\n",
       "    *   **Pros:** Quick for small amounts of water.\n",
       "    *   **Cons:** Can be uneven heating (potential for superheating, which is dangerous), not energy-efficient, can impart a plastic taste if using a plastic container.\n",
       "    *   **Best For:** Only in a pinch, very small amounts, be cautious.\n",
       "*   **Pot on Stovetop:**\n",
       "    *   **Pros:** Simple, uses a heat source you likely already have, can boil large quantities.\n",
       "    *   **Cons:** Can be slow, especially for small amounts, requires close supervision (to prevent boiling dry).\n",
       "    *   **Best For:** Boiling large quantities of water (e.g., for pasta), situations where you don't have a kettle.\n",
       "*   **Immersion Heater:**\n",
       "    *   **Pros:** Portable, useful when a heat source is not available.\n",
       "    *   **Cons:** Requires a container, potential dangers if not used carefully, slow.\n",

       "**Why is the Sky Blue?**\n",
       "\n",
       "The sky is blue because of a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's the simplified explanation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Sunlight Enters the Atmosphere:** Sunlight is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Scattering by Air Molecules:** As sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen). This collision causes the light to scatter in different directions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Rayleigh Scattering Favors Blue:** Rayleigh scattering is more effective at scattering shorter wavelengths of light. Blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths than other colors like red, orange, and yellow.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Why Not Violet Then?** While violet light is scattered even more than blue, there are a few reasons why we see the sky as blue:\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   The sun emits less violet light than blue light.\n",
       "    *   Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than violet light.\n",
       "    *   Some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **What About Sunset/Sunrise?** At sunrise and sunset, the sun's light has to travel through much more of the atmosphere to reach our eyes. This means that most of the blue light has been scattered away by the time it reaches us. The longer wavelengths, like red and orange, are able to penetrate through the atmosphere more easily, resulting in the reddish hues we see.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In short, the sky is blue because air molecules scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter other colors.**\n"

       "\n",
       "**1. Python:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Why it's great for beginners:**\n",
       "    *   **Readability:** Python has a very clear and easy-to-read syntax, often described as being \"like English.\"  This makes it easier to understand the logic and structure of your code, which is crucial when you're just starting out.\n",
       "    *   **Large and Supportive Community:** There's a HUGE online community of Python developers. This means tons of tutorials, libraries, and forums where you can get help when you're stuck.\n",
       "    *   **Versatility:** Python is used in a wide range of fields, including:\n",
       "        *   **Data Science:**  Analyzing data, creating visualizations (graphs and charts).\n",
       "        *   **Web Development:**  Building websites and web applications (although JavaScript is more front-end focused).\n",
       "        *   **Machine Learning/AI:**  Developing intelligent systems.\n",
       "        *   **Game Development:**  Using libraries like Pygame.\n",
       "        *   **Scripting/Automation:**  Automating tasks on your computer (e.g., renaming files, sending emails).\n",
       "    *   **Great Libraries:** Python has a vast ecosystem of pre-built libraries (modules) that provide ready-made solutions for common tasks. You don't have to reinvent the wheel!\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Possible Downsides:**\n",
       "    *   **Speed:**  Python can be slightly slower than some other languages (like C++ or Java) for computationally intensive tasks. However, this is usually not a concern for beginners or for many common projects.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. JavaScript:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Why it's a good choice:**\n",
       "    *   **Web Development Focus:** JavaScript is *essential* for front-end web development. It's what makes websites interactive (e.g., buttons that do things, animations, dynamic content). If you're interested in creating websites that users can interact with, JavaScript is a must-learn.\n",
       "    *   **Ubiquity:**  JavaScript runs in every web browser.\n",
       "    *   **Node.js:**  JavaScript can also be used for back-end web development (server-side) using Node.js. This means you can use JavaScript for the entire web application.\n",
       "    *   **Large Community:** Like Python, JavaScript has a huge and active community.\n",
       "    *   **Interactive and Visual:** You get immediate visual feedback as you're learning JavaScript by seeing your code change the way a website looks and behaves.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Possible Downsides:**\n",
       "    *   **Can be Tricky:**  JavaScript has some quirks and nuances that can be confusing for beginners (e.g., asynchronous programming, the `this` keyword).\n",
       "    *   **Front-End Focus (initially):** While JavaScript *can* be used for back-end development, you'll typically start by learning how to manipulate web pages, which may not appeal to everyone.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Fortran:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Why it's *not* recommended for most high school students (at least not as a first language):**\n",
       "    *   **Specialized:** Fortran is primarily used in scientific and engineering computing (e.g., weather forecasting, computational fluid dynamics).  It's very powerful for those domains, but not as broadly applicable as Python or JavaScript.\n",
       "    *   **Older Syntax:** Fortran's syntax can feel less modern and less intuitive than Python or JavaScript.\n",
       "    *   **Smaller Community:** The Fortran community is smaller compared to Python or JavaScript, which means fewer readily available resources and less help when you get stuck.\n",
       "    *   **Less Beginner-Friendly:** Fortran is generally not considered a beginner-friendly language.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **If you're interested in data science, machine learning, general-purpose programming, or want a very easy-to-learn language, choose Python.**\n",
       "*   **If you're passionate about web development and want to build interactive websites, choose JavaScript.**\n",
       "*   **Avoid Fortran unless you have a specific reason to learn it related to scientific computing.**\n",
       "\n",
       "**Here's my recommended learning path (regardless of which language you choose):**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Start with the Basics:** Focus on fundamental programming concepts:\n",
       "    *   Variables\n",
       "    *   Data types (numbers, strings, booleans)\n",
       "    *   Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)\n",
       "    *   Conditional statements (if/else)\n",
       "    *   Loops (for, while)\n",
       "    *   Functions\n",
       "2.  **Practice, Practice, Practice:** The best way to learn is by doing.  Work through tutorials, solve coding challenges (e.g., on websites like HackerRank, LeetCode, Codecademy), and build small projects.\n",
       "3.  **Learn to Debug:**  Debugging is a crucial skill. Learn how to use debugging tools to find and fix errors in your code.\n",
       "4.  **Join the Community:**  Participate in online forums, ask questions, and help others.\n",
       "5.  **Build Projects:**  Once you have a solid foundation, start working on larger projects that you're passionate about.  This is where you'll really solidify your skills and learn new things.\n",

    "Another way to improve response quality is to add examples in your prompt. The LLM learns in-context from the examples on how to respond. Typically, one to five examples (shots) are enough to improve the quality of responses. Including too many examples can cause the model to over-fit the data and reduce the quality of responses.\n",

Pick examples that are representative of the scenarios that you need the model to learn, and keep the distribution of the examples (e.g. number of examples per class in the case of classification) aligned with your actual distribution."
